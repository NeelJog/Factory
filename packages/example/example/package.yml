#The package.yml file contains the location of models to be loaded from Blender files.
#The name of the objects map to the name of a collection in the blender file.

# This package uses bundled package data. The data is located in the package itself under
# a sub directory defined by the 'example' logical name.
# The logical name is then used in the "objects" block to refer to that location.
# For instance, "example:LowPoly.blend" refers to "data/LowPoly.blend" in the example
# package directory
